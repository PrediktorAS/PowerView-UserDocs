# State Code Setup

The state codes are configured for each plant in a web page in the plant portal. See Equipment stop codes general.

Each state code has a class, which defines how it is treated in the report and how it is treated in the availability calculations.

Normally, states are configured by Prediktor engineers during system configuration.
