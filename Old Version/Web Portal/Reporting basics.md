# Reporting basics

Reports are opened from the menu, and each portal have a different set of reports available (see the specific description for each (portal/plant). The reports are configured and customized based on stanard reporting tools. The data sources for the reports are multiple database, with the following main grouping:

* Time series (trend) data from APIS Honeystore time series database
    * E.g. 1 minute samples of the irradiation measurement or inverter power
* Event based data stored in the APIS Click&Trace MES database
    * E.g. alarms&events and inverter state data
* Aggregated data from data warehouse
    * E.g. common facility data

Each report normally has a filtering part, where the user can specify what kind of data to retrieve, time period, etc. After specifying the data filtering, the report is generated an presented on the screen.

Graphical and textual presentation elements are used to show the data on the screen, and the presentation and layout is configured for each report. Some reports are only designed for presentation on screen, while others are designed also for print out. Export of data to other programs, like Excel or pdf, is available for most of the reports.

See the reporting section for more details on each report type.
