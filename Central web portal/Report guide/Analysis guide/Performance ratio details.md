# Performance ratio details

Result and sub parameters of performance ratio calculations, based on plant formula.

Data is calculated for a time period and presented as numbers.

Input parameter:

* Start and End period: used if not period is used. Un-check both boxes before use.
* Period type and period: select report period if not start and end time is used
* Report description: used in the heading of the report

Report elements:

* Performance ratio (%): long term performance ratio calculated for period based on formula
* Measured yield (MWh): measured yield for period. Energy production based on manually adjusted production.
* Nominal power (MW): nominal DC power for plant from plant parameters
* Irradiance incline (Wh/m2): measured incline accumulated irradiation for period
* Irradiance standard (W/m2): plant constant from plant parameters
* Module degradation factor:  plant constant from plant parameters
* Down time coefficient - Kd: calculation based on formula
* Nominal plant availability (%):   plant constant from plant parameters
* First installation date (dd.mm.yyyy):  plant constant from plant parameters
* Last installation date (dd.mm.yyyy):  plant constant from plant parameters
