# Deemed Energy

This report shows data used for deemed energy payment calculations.

Energy calculations is based on manually adjusted production numbers.

Input parameter:

* Start and end date and time
* number of preceding days
* Report description for header

Report elements:

* Deemed energy factors:
    * Facility availability - FA (%): plant availability from plant availability standard calculations 
    * Energy output factor - E/Es: factor for calculating theoretical energy production based on irradiation
    * Expected energy output - EO (MWh): theoretical energy production based on irradiation
* Daily values, energy output and irradiation:
    * Background values for above factors
* Grid/facility non-operation caused by Eskom: Table showing all grid states indicating Eskom failure
* Irradiance values for period: 10 minute average incline irradiation measurement for period
