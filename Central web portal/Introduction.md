# Introduction

The central reporting system consist of a reporting part and a control and monitoring part, all contained in one central web portal. Data from the different plants are replicated into the central servers and used for real time and historical reporting.

Real time and time series data is replicated into one database for each plant, including the event based plant data. These data is used directly in the SCADA portal for dynamic HMI screens and plant reports.

The plant data is extracted from the plant databases and stored in one common PowerView data warehouse, containing data for all plants. Using the central reports, data from all plants can be viewed separately or in common reports.
