# Portal Navigation General

The web portal from the central server is opened with the URL address http://solardemo.prediktor.no/PowerView/Login3.aspx

Starting the portal and logging in is as described in Web portal basics.

The menu is built up with one main folder for enterprise functions and one folder for each plant, located under the continent folder as follows:

* Enterprise
* Africa
    * Morocco            
    * Nigeria ....
* Asia

Under each plant folder, sub folders are found for:

* Plant monitoring
* Reporting
* Analysis

Under Enterprise, following main nodes are found:

* Reports
* Analysis
* Manual input
* Administration    

Plant monitoring and plant reports are more or less the pages found on plant SCADA solution (if present). Data is collected from the central server databases and real time store though, containing replicated data from the plants. The only data collected directly from the plant is the alarms, which is collected directly from the plant alarms&events server. This is in order to be able to acknowledeg alarms.

The user roles found on the central server can be found here.
