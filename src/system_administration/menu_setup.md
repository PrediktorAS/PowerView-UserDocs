Menu and portal pages are configured by a system administrator in web portal screens.

Portal pages defines links to user screens. This can be custom pages or standard pages, as well as links to external web pages/systems.

Adding a new page in the Portal pages screens, user add type, name, description, and a absolute or relative URL to the portal page. A page is added to one or more access groups to gain access for user through the access control system. 

The Menu page defines the menu three. In this page, menu nodes are configured, linked to portal pages. One defines folder items, folder items with links or leaf node pages linked to a page. 
The leaf nodes, selects a portal page from a list of available pages.

The items are ordered and placed under a sub folder. The order is relative within the folder. Menu items can be hidden un-checking the "Visible in menu" item.
