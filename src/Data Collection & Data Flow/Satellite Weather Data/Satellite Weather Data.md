# Satellite Weather Data

Historical weather data can be collected from 3. party providers (like SolarGIS, Meteologica and Enercast).
These services is integrated with standards API's and data is retreived with wanted resolution and update rate and stored in PowerView databases.
Update rates down to 5 minutes can be achieved. 
Typically data is collected once every night for the previous day and typical resolution is 15 min.

Satellite weather data can be used as main source of weather data to calculate KPI's or used to replace missing data from plant sensors when not present due to data loss.
