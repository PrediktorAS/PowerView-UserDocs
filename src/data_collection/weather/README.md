# How we relate to the weather

As the production of renewable energy is largely dependent on the weather, we need to keep strict records of the observed/historical weather as well as the predicted/forecast weather. This data is used for a myriad of purposes, including:

* Predicting the production of energy
* Comparing the predicted production of energy with the actual production
* Understanding losses in production due to weather

## Budgeted weather

To be able to budget production, and thus income, we need to have a budgeted weather. This is a weather forecast for the entire budget period, which is typically a year. Having a separate budgeted weather allows us to compare the actual weather with the budgeted weather, and thus see if the production is on track with the budget. It also leaves a paper trail of the weather used for budgeting, which is important for auditing purposes.
