# Manually Excluded Energy Losses

Energy production can be manually excluded and registered as losses using the inpout screen for [Production Correction Factor](../../../user_interfaces/manual/production_correction_factor.md).
The correction factor registered is used to calculate the Manually Excluded Energy Losses

## Calculations
> Manually Excluded Energy Losses = [Actual Production](../yield_and_weather/production.md) * ( 1 - [Production Correction Factor](../../../user_interfaces/manual/production_correction_factor.md)) / [Production Correction Factor](../../../user_interfaces/manual/production_correction_factor.md)
