# Tracker down time production losses

Following algorithm is implemented in SCADA to estimate production loss on trackers.
- Tracker losses E_loss_tracker calculated per tracker when state is Idle or Failure.
    - Losses calculated per 10 minute per tracker and summarized on plant. 
    - Losses are categorized into following sub categories in addition to total losses:
        -	Failure
        -	Manual parked
        -	Wind Stow
        -	Out of position

Algorithm:
- E_loss_tracker  = E_ref  *  (1 â€“ GII_tracker / GII_reference)

- E_ref: reference production for tracker
    - E_ref = E_plant *  ( Pnom_tracker /  Pnom_plant )   
        - E_plant: plant production
            - [Actual Production](../../Yield%20and%20Weather/Actual%20Production/Actual%20Production.md) on plant
            - If E_measured_plant does not exist for 10 min period, use [Estimated Production](../../Yield%20and%20Weather/Estimated%20Production/Estimated%20Production.md) 
        - Pnom_tracker: nominal DC power connected to tracker
        - Pnom_plant: nominial DC power for plant        

- GII_tracker:  incline irradiance for tracker calculated from GHI_measured and tracker angles 
    - GII_tracker = diffuse_fraction * GHI_measured * 0.5 * (1 + cos(theta_tracker)) + (1 - diffuse_fraction) * DNI * cos(aoi_tracker)
- GII_reference: incline irradiance for reference trackers calculated from GHI_measured and tracker angles
    - GII_reference = diffuse_fraction * GHI_measured * 0.5 * (1 + cos(theta_reference)) + (1 - diffuse_fraction) * DNI * cos(aoi_reference)
- GHI_measured is measured [horizontal irradiation](../../Yield%20and%20Weather/Horizontal%20Irradiation/Horizontal%20Irradiation.md)
- GII_measured is measured [incline irradiation](../../Yield%20and%20Weather/Incline%20Irradiation/Incline%20Irradiation.md)

- theta_tracker and theta_reference are measured tracker angles for parked and working reference trackers respectively
    - Reference trackers: Using median angles for working trackers for plant
- DNI: DNI is direct normal irradiation
    - GHI * (1-diffuse_fraction) / cos(solar_zenith)
- aoi_tracker and aoi_reference are angle of incidence on parked and reference trackers and calculated as follows: 
    - aoi = arccos(projection)
        - Clip to {0,85}
    - projection =  (cos(surface_tilt) * cos(solar_zenith) +sin(surface_tilt) * sin(solar_zenith) *cos(solar_azimuth - surface_azimuth))
        - surface_tilt = abs(tracker_angle)
            - tracker_angle: theta_tracker for aoi_tracker and theta_reference for aoi_reference
        - surface_azimuth = 90 if tracker_angle < 0 else 270
        - solar_zenith: solar zenith angle clipped on 85 degrees
        - solar_azimuth: solar azimuth angle
        - Clip to {-1, 1}
- diffuse_fraction: Diffuse fraction is calculated as follows 
    - diffuse_fraction = ( TF_clearsky - TF_measured) / (TF_clearsky - TF_diffuse)
        - TF_clearsky = cos(aoi_reference) / cos(solar_zenith)
        - TF_diffuse = 0.5 * (1 + cos(theta_reference))
        - TF_meas = GII_measured / GHI_measured
        - Clip to {0.1, 1}
    - In center of day when tracker angles < 30 degrees
        - diffuse_fraction = mean(diffuse_fraction) where abs(theta_reference) > 30 degrees for that day
    - During backtracking, using diffuse_fraction as calculated, even when theta < 30 degrees
-	Negative tracker losses not allowed: when E_loss_tracker<0 then E_loss_tracker = 0
