# Production Losses due to Soiling
Soiling is dust and grime gathering on the panels, reducing the amount of light reaching the solar cells. This is a common problem in dry and dusty areas, and can be a significant source of production losses. The Soiling Index is explained [here](../yield_and_weather/soiling_index.md) related to measured energy production:


## Calculation

> Soiling losses = ([Actual Production](../yield_and_weather/production.md) / (1-([Soiling Index](../yield_and_weather/soiling_index.md)/100))) - [Actual Production](../yield_and_weather/production.md)
