# Inverter KPI's

Following KPI's are calculated for each inverter and resolution down to 10 minute period:

| KPI name | Unit | KPI description |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Energy Production |Wh|AC Energy outpunt from inverter|
|Down Time |s|Measured down time in seconds|
|Down Time |%|Calculated down time percentage|
|Availability |%|Inverter availability time based|
|Estimated Down Time Production Loss |Wh|Estimated losses for inverter|
|Average Input DC Power |W|Measured DC input power|
|Average Output AC Power |W|Measured AC output active power|
|Average Output Reactive  Power |VAr|Measured AC output reactive power|
|AC/DC Conversion Efficiency ||Measured ratio AC/DC power|
|Specific Energy Production |Wh/Wp|AC ouput vs DC power connected to inverter|
|Specific Energy Production compared to  median |%|Specific Energy Production vs. median of all inverters on plant|
|PR Net |%|Net performance ratio on inverter|
