# Performance Ratio Gross (PR Gross)

Using [Performance Ratio Net](pr_net.md) as basis, we divide by the Plant and Grid Availabilities Daylight to get a rough PR estimate representative for time when park has produced.

## Formula

> PR Gross = PR Net / PAd / GAdg

### Variables
- `PR Net`: [PR Net](pr_net.md)
- `PAd`: [Plant availability daylight](../availability_and_downtime/plant_availability.md)
- `GAdg`: [Grid availability daylight gross](../availability_and_downtime/grid_availability.md)
