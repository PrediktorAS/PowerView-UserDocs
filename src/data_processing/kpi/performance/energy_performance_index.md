# Energy Performance Index

Energy Performance Index (EPI) is calculated as the relation between the production actual vs. budget and the irradiation actual vs budget.

## Formula

> EPI = 100 * (100 + ([Actual Production](../yield_and_weather/production.md) - [Budget Production](../yield_and_weather/production.md) ) / [Budget Production](../yield_and_weather/irradiation.md) )) / (100 + ([Actual Irradiation](../yield_and_weather/irradiation.md) - [Budget Irradiation](../yield_and_weather/irradiation.md)) / [Budget Irradiation](../yield_and_weather/irradiation.md))
