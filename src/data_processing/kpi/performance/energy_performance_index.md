# Energy Performance Index

Energy Performance Index (EPI) is calculated as the relation between the production actual vs. budget and the irradiation actual vs budget.
In reality, this is the same as another more common definition of the EPI as ratio between the observed Specific Yield and the Expected Yield. Specific yield is here the actual production and Expected yield is the budgeted production. 

## Formula

> EPI = 100 * (100 + ([Actual Production](../yield_and_weather/production.md) - [Budget Production](../yield_and_weather/production.md) ) / [Budget Production](../yield_and_weather/irradiation.md) )) / (100 + ([Actual Irradiation](../yield_and_weather/irradiation.md) - [Budget Irradiation](../yield_and_weather/irradiation.md)) / [Budget Irradiation](../yield_and_weather/irradiation.md))
