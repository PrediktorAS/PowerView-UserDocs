# Actual Production

Plant production is calculated from counters on energy meters. Energy counter is split in 10 minutes intervals, and production as difference in counter at start and end of interval is calculated and stored in data warehouse. 
Plant production can be corrected in manual correction page [Production Correction](../../../../user_interfaces/Manual%20Data%20Registration/Production%20Correction/Production%20Correction.md).
