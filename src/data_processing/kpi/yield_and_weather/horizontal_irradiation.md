# Horizontal Irradiation

Horizontal irradiation is calculated from horizontal irradiation pyranometer sensors as first source. 
Sensors are filtered according to rules in [Weather sensor filtering](../../data_filtering/weather_sensor_filtering.md).

If data is missing for a period, data is backfilled from external data source.
