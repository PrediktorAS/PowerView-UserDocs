# Language and Engineering Units

Variables and signals in web pages are viewed with engineering units (e.g. MW for active power values).

Google Chrome installed in English Windows OS will use English US language by default. This result in US engineering units e.g. temperature values displayed as Fahrenheit etc.

To change this, the English US language must be replaced with English (United Kingdom).

Open settings in Chrome pressing or  and selecting “settings” from menu in upper right corner of browser to change the language.
