# Standard Reports & Dashboards

Prediktor PowerView™ contains an extensive set of standard reports. Additional reports can be configured, e.g. based upon specific requirements grid owners. The various reports are parameterized with appropriate user defined elements such as reporting period, plant selection, etc.

The reports can be exported to Excel, as CSV-files or be generated as PDF-files.

A selection of available reports is listed below:

| Report Name | Description | 
|---------|---------|
|Actual vs Budget Report | Actual numbers vs. budget |
|Alarm History Report |Alarm history for all alarm transactions for a plant|
|Availability Report | Provides detailed information on equipment availability |
|Budget report | Shows data for selected budget. |
|CO2 Emission Report | Shows CO2 emission data for portfolio based on year and plant specific emission factors |
|Daily Management Report | Provides for a user selection of facilities production data vs budget data. Data is provided for a selected date and month to date and year to date. Included data elements are production amount, plant/grid/tracker availabilities, selected environmental data, various performance ration numbers. |
