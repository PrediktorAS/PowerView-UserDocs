# User Access

Access to the system is defined by a user name and a password. (NB: not same as your Windows user). These users are defined and registered by a system administrator of the system. This can be a personal user or a user name used by several users (e.g. PlantOperator).

Each user has one or more system roles, which defines the access level when entering the system. The roles can be different for each plant or central portal. See the documentation for each plant or the enterprise portal to see roles available.

Contact system administrator at PowerView to change access rights to system.

Note that the user name and password are not common between plant and central system. You need ask for user for both of them.
