# Web Portal Basics

The web portal is the main user interface of the solution for the user. The web portal is opened in Google Chrome web browser, and are optimized for the resolution of 1920 * 1080. To be able to view the trend curves, Java must also be installed on the client PC. In addition, the user must have access to the network hosting the system server (central or plant system). If you don't have access, ask one of the super users of the solution.

To open the web portal, open the Google Chrome application on your PC and enter the address (URL) you have been given in the address field of the browser. For the plant systems, the address will be of the form:

```http://<server>/<portal name>/Login3.aspx```

For the central web portal, the address is:

```http://<publicIP>/PowerView/Login3.aspx```

The first page will be the login page. Enter your username and password and you will get access to the system, showing the welcome screen.

Each user has a set of access rights in the system, which defines what items will be available from the menu to the left. Select items from the menu to access different HMI screens, input screens and reports from the system.

Open a menu item by clicking on the item in the menu.

Right click and press "open in new tab" to open the menu item in another tab in the same browser windows.

Right click and press "open in new window" to open the menu item in a new window.

Pressing some links opens a new «pop-up» window. E.g. clicking on inverter number in overview screen.

Each plant web portal has the following main menu folders:

Monitoring
Control (if control functions available)
Manual data input
Reports
System setup
