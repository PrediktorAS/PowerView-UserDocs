# Navigation in screens

The screen contains links and navigation elements to navigate to other related pages. Holding the mouse over an element having navigation behavior, will show a hand as the mouse pointer. Below some of the most common navigation methods:

* Clicking on top row with active alarm opens alarm pop-up window
* Clicking on  symbol opens single or multiple graphs (workspace) in APIS Process Explorer
* Clicking on inverter number opens inverter page. E.g. clicking on the inverter status symbol  in the plant overview.

The top bar of the monitoring screens, shows last active alarm on the system. Clicking on the header, opens the alarm list in a pop-up window.

The pop-up windows opens in new window and must be closed pressing the upper right cross on the window. You can have it open as long as you want.
