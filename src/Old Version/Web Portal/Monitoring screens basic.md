# Monitoring screens basic

The real time monitoring of the plant is done through a set of dynamic user screens. The screens present real time and historical trend data from plant measurement data. The data can be a combination of real time value, trend values and event based values like equipment alarms.

The presentation of the data is flexible, and each screen is configured for easy use and easy reading of the data. Failure and problem detection is important, and color coding is used to present problems. In general, red color indicates a problem and green is ok.

A description of the specific screens are found under the section for each plant.
