# System Infrastructure

The system is running on one or more servers. Typically there are one or more servers on each plant for local data collection and local user monitoring interface. The local user interface is not present when no local operator control room is present.  

A network link must be present between the plant servers and the central servers. This link can be a established broad band infrastructure, or a new satellite or microwave link.

Prediktor maintains the solution through a VPN link to the plant and central server.
