# Failure And Repair Time Calculation

Failure and repair time is calculated from the state database.

Failure rate is calculated as the number of state changes to a Non-Operational state (failure or idle) within a period per equipment/device

Average repair time is calculated as the average time duration of Non-Operational states.
