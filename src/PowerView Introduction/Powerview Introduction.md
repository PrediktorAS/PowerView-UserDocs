# PowerView Introduction

PowerView™, based on 26 years of continuous technology development and industrial experience, addresses the needs of Technical Asset Management organizations to optimize plant and portfolio performance.

Efficient operation of any solar plant is essential to ensure the budgeted energy production is met, that operations are done according to regulations and that the O&M is done in an efficient manner.

Optimal operations include early fault detection, structured maintenance procedure, efficient reporting, production forecasting and diagnostics. All these challenges need to be executed on production sites often located in rural locations with little, or no, local manning and limited communication infrastructure.

Prediktor PowerView™ is an open and scalable solution, enabling efficient operation of solar plants and handles all essential Technical Asset Management activities in one centralized system.

PowerView™ integrates information from all operational systems - including inverters, trackers, sub-stations, meteorological instruments, etc.

PowerView™ has a highly scalable architecture suitable for most plant and portfolio configurations.

Prediktor’s PowerView™ can be connected to an existing local SCADA gathering data in a central server. Alternatively, if no local SCADA exist, the system can connect directly to the field equipment and available instrumentation, act as a local SCADA in addition to relaying data to the central system.
