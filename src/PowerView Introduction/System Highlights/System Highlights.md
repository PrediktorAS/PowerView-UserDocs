# PowerView System Highlights



| Feature | Description |
|---------|---------|
| Web enabled | All user interfaces are web enabled and reachable anywhere, anytime via web browser connected to a secure and authorized connection |
| Scalable | Integrate all your production sites into one standard reporting hub as well as expandable field equipment integration. Data replication from local sites to central system is configured based upon available bandwidth. |
| Open | Supports a wide range of communication standards for integration with field equipment and other 3. party applications.  |
| Adaptable | A set of standard system functions are available out-of-the box from the system. Moreover, we know that our clients have their own specific requirements in terms of reporting, monitoring, external systems integration etc. The system is based on a flexible architecture enabling modification and expansion of the standard set of capabilities. |
| Data availability | Clients have full ownership to own asset data. Data sets are available for BI analysis via standard APIs. |
| Data replication | Replication of real-time and historical data are done from the production sites to a central repository. Site software has data buffering for data redundancy and data loss minimization.  |
| SCADA | Realtime monitoring and control at the local sites as well as from integrated operations centre. Set point control, e.g. for power plant control and trackers is available from both local and central operation If needed. |
| Alarm management | Alarms are relayed from the plant control systems as well as triggered within the O&M system upon violation of defined operational boundaries. Alarms can be distributed on e-mail as well as SMS |
| KPI reporting | Several industrial standard KPIs, such as performance ratio, energy performance index, and availability are implemented in the system. Additional customer specific performance indicators can be configured based upon specific client needs. |
| Asset availability | Availability of plant assets are registered automatically enabling full control of reasons for production loss. Availability of grid, inverters, string and trackers are included.  |
| Advanced diagnostics | Detect and act upon abnormal operating conditions using our diagnostics algorithms.  |
| Forecasting | Long-term and short-term production forecasting is made possible by integration with site instrumentation and external weather services.  |
| Reporting | All operational reporting is done from one system â€“ for operational and production reporting purposes. The system contains a standard set of reporting capabilities which can easily be expanded with client-specific reports. |
| Budget baseline | Financial and operational budgets are entered into the system and enables tight insight into relative operational performance. |
| Status monitoring | Fleet and plant monitoring with drill-down capabilities on real-time information from the whole plant portfolio. | Device status information (operational, non-operational, failure etc.) is logged and retrievable from e.g. asset availability reporting.
| Maintenance management | Integration with external maintenance management systems. Work order request and ticketing generation and forwarding to CMMS solutions.  |
