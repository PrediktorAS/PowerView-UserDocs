# Estimated Production

Estimated production per 10 minute periods used for loss calculations are calculated based on following algorithm:
- EstimatedProduction = time integration (EstimatedACPower)
- EstimatedACPower = EstimatedDCPower * InverterEfficiency * 
(1- InverterMiscLosses) * (1 â€“ PlantMiscLosses)
- EstimatedDCPower = NominalDCPower * (InclineIrradiation / 1000) *
(1 - TemperatureLosses) * (1 - InverterDCLosses) * ModuleEfficiency
- TemperatureLosses = (CellTemperature - 25) * (ModuleTempCoeff / 100)
- CellTemperature = ModuleTemperatureMeasured + 3 * (InClineIrradiation / 1000)
