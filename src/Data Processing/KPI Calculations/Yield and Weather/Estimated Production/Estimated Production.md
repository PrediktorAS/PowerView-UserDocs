# Estimated Production

Estimated production per 10 minute periods used for loss calculations are calculated based on following algorithm:
- Estimated Production = time integration (EstimatedACPower)

- EstimatedACPower = EstimatedDCPower * InverterEfficiency * (1- InverterMiscLosses) * (1 â€“ PlantMiscLosses)

- EstimatedDCPower = NominalDCPower * ([Incline Irradiation](../Incline%20Irradiation/Incline%20Irradiation.md) / 1000) * (1 - TemperatureLosses) * (1 - InverterDCLosses) * ModuleEfficiency
    - TemperatureLosses = ([Estimated cell temperature](../Module%20Temperature/Module%20Temperature.md) - 25) * (ModuleTempCoeff / 100)
