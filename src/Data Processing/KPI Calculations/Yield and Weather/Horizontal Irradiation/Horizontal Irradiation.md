# Horizontal Irradiation

Horizontal irradiation is calculated from horizontal irradiation pyranometer sensors as first source. 
Sensors are filtered according to rules in [Weather sensor filtering](Weather%20sensor%20filtering.md).

If data is missing for a period, data is backfilled from external data source.
