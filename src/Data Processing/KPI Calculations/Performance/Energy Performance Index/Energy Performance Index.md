# Energy Performance Index

Energy Performance Index (EPI) is calculated as the relation between the production actual vs. budget and the irradiation actual vs budget.

EPI = 100 * (100 + ([Actual Production](../../Yield%20and%20Weather/Actual%20Production/Actual%20Production.md) - [Budget Production](../../Yield%20and%20Weather/Budget%20Production/Budget%20Production.md) ) / [Budget Production](../../Yield%20and%20Weather/Budget%20Production/Budget%20Production.md) )) / (100 + ([Actual Irradiation](../../Yield%20and%20Weather/Incline%20Irradiation/Incline%20Irradiation.md) - [Budget Irradiation](../../Yield%20and%20Weather/Budget%20Irradiation/Budget%20Irradiation.md)) / [Budget Irradiation](../../Yield%20and%20Weather/Budget%20Irradiation/Budget%20Irradiation.md))
