# String KPI's

Following KPI's are calculated for each string set (channel) and resolution down to daily period:

| KPI name | Unit | KPI description |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Average ampere per string |A| Average output current|
| Ampere hours per string |Ah| Total current hours|
| Average DC voltage |V| Average string DC voltage|
| Average plant DC voltage |V| Average DC voltage on all strings|
| Average power |W| Average string DC power|
| Produced energy per string |Wh| Energy produced on string|
| Specific energy |Wh/Wp| Energy produced on string vs DC power connected on string|
| Specific energy group median |Wh/Wp| Median specific energy on strings on same combiner/string inverter|
| Specific energy plant median |Wh/Wp| Median specific energy on all strings in plant|
| Deviation from specific energy group median |Wh/Wp| Absolute deviation between string and group |
| Deviation from specific energy plant median |Wh/Wp| Absolute deviation between string and plant |
| Specific energy relative to group median|| Factor between string and group|
| Specific energy relative to plant median|| Factor between string and plant|
| Percentage deviation from specific energy group median  |%| Percentage deviation between string and group |
| Percentage deviation from specific energy plant median  |%| Percentage deviation between string and plant |
| Number of continous days until current date below warning 3 level|| Number of contoinous days with percentage deviation from specific energy group median below 92%  |
| Number of continous days until current date below warning 2 level|| Number of contoinous days with percentage deviation from specific energy group median between 92% and 95% |
| Number of continous days until current date below warning 1 level|| Number of contoinous days with percentage deviation from specific energy group median between 95% and 98% |
