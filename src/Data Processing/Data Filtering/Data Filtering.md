# Data filtering

Data is filtered in several ways on the way from sensor signal to user presentation:
- Data quality based on sensor connectivity
- Data quality based on data quality attribute from sensor
- Data validation based on valid range on signal (e.g. min/max irradiation values)
- Data validation and outlier detection when loading data in data warehouse
