# User Access

Access to the system is defined by a user name and a password. (NB: not same as your Windows user). These users are defined and registered by a PowerView system administrator. This can be a personal user or a user name used by several users (e.g. PlantOperator).

Each user has one or more system roles, which defines the access level when entering the system. The roles can be different for each plant or central portal. See the documentation for each plant or the enterprise portal to see roles available.

Contact your system administrator to get a new user or change access rights to system.
