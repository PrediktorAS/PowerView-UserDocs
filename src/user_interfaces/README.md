# User Interfaces

The [PowerView web portal](Using%20the%20PowerView%20Portal/Using%20the%20PowerView%20Portal.md) is hosting the applications and user screens to access the PowerView user interface. Users log into web portal with username and password. Username is linked to roles in system, defining access to the different sites, screens and applications. The menu is then filled with the available screens and tools.
