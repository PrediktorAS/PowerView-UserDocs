# Downtime Correction

The purpose of the downtime correction pages is to let the user adjust the process times that has been registered on the grid, inverters and/or trackers.
By navigating into these pages, you are able to:
- Adjust the process times set on one or several equipment from one state to another
- Set the process time of your choice within a certain time range.

Usage (initial)
- Open the registration pages.
- Click on the Equipment box and choose Facility and type of equipment.
    - Note: you can either choose All equipment or pick single/multiple devices if needed.
- Click on Apply.
- Choose the Time Period by clicking on the button “Time Period” and then choose the start time and end time in the date picker that is popping up.
    - Note: you can set the exact time by clicking on the “hours:minutes” entry in the top right corner in the pop-up dialogue box.
- Click on Apply

Usage (changes)
After “Facility”, “equipment type” and “time and date” has been chosen, you will see all the entries for that timeframe in a list on the screen.
Swapping a process time code with another:
- Click on the line with the code you would like to change. Example: “310 – Operation with warning”.
- From the dropdown menu choose another state. Example. “309 – Operation”
- This will change all the previous states with the new state within the timeframe given.
- Write a comment and click apply and the changes are done.

Setting a process time in a given timeframe
- Find the line you would like to change - Example: “310 – Operation with warning” – and click on the “Start time”. This will let you set a new start time for the process time. Do the same for the “End time” to set an end time.
- Write a comment and click apply. The changes are done.

Note: if only one (or more) of the devices needs to be adjusted, then start by clicking on the far left number on the line to open up alle the registered times on all the sub-devices. 
Then do your changes as above on the devices of your choice!
