# Control

Prediktor PowerView™ has implemented capabilities also to enable set point and mode control on plant control systems. This can be implemented to change an operational program and/or single setpoints for a set of different equipment and devices on the plant. 

Implementations includes:
-	Power Plant Controller 
-	Inverter
-	Tracker
-	Substation control system
-	Energy Management Systems 

In order to facilitate for this, the control system needs to be configured for external control of the defined tags. 

Such controls can only be performed by operators with a higher level of authority and an extra level of authorization is required to perform this. Also, security can be configured such that this control only can be performed from a predefined set of PowerView™ clients.
