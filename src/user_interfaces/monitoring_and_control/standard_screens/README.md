# Standard Screens

Following standard screens exist on portfolio level:
- [Portfolio Overview](portfolio_overview.md)
- [Attention Screen](attention_screen.md)
- [World Map](world_map.md)


Plant specific screens available from templates and adapated to plant setup:

| Name | Description | 
|---------|---------|
|Plant Overview	| Provides additional data of a plant with running status of inverters and trackers, power, yield and forecasting data as well as power graphs with max/min/average power vs. irradiation.The screen also displays the internal power distribution from substations to the grid connection point. Drilldown to plant equipment details. |
|Overall Production Overview|	Graphical presentation of current status, power and energy yield. Drill down to inverter details. |
|String Monitor Overview|	Graphical presentation of performance of all strings for all inverters. Drill-down to string monitor details with alarming.  |
|Transformer Switch Overview	| 	Graphical lay-out of energy distribution inverters, substations, transformers to grid connection. |
|Inverter Details	| 	Details are shown from selected inverter along with produced energy vs. irradiation. Also, inverter alarms are visualized. |
|Inverter Power Overview	| 	Trend graphs showing inverter active power over a day. |
|Inverter Insulation Overview	| 	Trend graphs showing inverter insulation resistance over a day. |
|Substation Overview	| 	Operational data from grid connection point. Provides information on transformer, switch and substation information, feed in (re)active power/energy, (re)active power/energy consumption. Data from MV energy meters as well as auxiliary meters. |
|PPC Data	| 	Provides information status information on power plant controllers |
|Tracker Overview	| 	Provides a graphical representation of the solar trackers with operational conditions and visualization on actual angles versus set-points. Drilldown from overview to single  |tracker.
|Weather Data	| 	Current and historical data from weather stations and irradiation from reference cells and/or pyranometers |
|Alarm List	| List of current and historical alarms with information on alarm source time of occurrence, acknowledge time and description. The list is filterable on alarm type and source.   |
