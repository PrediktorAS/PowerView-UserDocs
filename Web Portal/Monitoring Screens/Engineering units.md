# Engineering units

Most tags have an engineering unit, e.g. kW. the unit is registered on the real time and on the historical tags. Most tags have basic SI units like A, V and Wh as its basic unit. Another unit can be used for presentation though, using a conversion factor. E.g. energy is measured in Wh from the meters, but displayed as MWh.

It is also possible to switch from SI metric units to e.g. American units. If your operating system is configured with English US language in web browser, American units will be shown. See web browser setup for how to change the language settings.
