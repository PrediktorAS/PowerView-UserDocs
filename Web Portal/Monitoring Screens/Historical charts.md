# Historical charts

Some charts, and also single values, are presenting historical and aggregated data based on a specific time period and interval. The period and interval are selected in drop down boxes and input fields abov ore below the chart. The chart or data fields might be updated right away when changing the filter data, but it might be that the update must be triggered using the "Update" button or the "R" button.

In the upper right corner of the chart, buttons are shown to change the presentation of the data:

* ![Excel](../../Images/Excel.png) exporting the data in tabular format to Excel
* ![Table](../../Images/Tabular%20format.png) presenting data in tabular format on screen
* ![Graph](../../Images/Line%20graph.png) present data as line graph
