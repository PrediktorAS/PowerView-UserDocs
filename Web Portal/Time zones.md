# Time zones

Time related data is stored in the databases in Universial Time Coordinates (UTC).

When presenting data in tables and graphs in the web pages, one can choose which time zone the data is converted to before presented in web page.

The time zones in a web page is specified with a default value. The time zone is chosen and used when selected the page from the menu. When user changes the time zone in the page, this time zone is used for the page and pop-ups from the page, until page is re-opened from the menu. Default time zone is then used again.

The time zone used is presented in top of web page (in header). In monitoring pages and plant reports, the time zone is shown to the left in the header like shown below:
