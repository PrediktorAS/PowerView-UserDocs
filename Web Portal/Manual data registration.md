# Manual data registration

Most data collection in the system is automatic, based on real time signals from equipment and meters. However, some data must be entered or corrected manually. These data is entered in web user screens found in the plant portal menu. The data is stored in the plant database and transferred to the central system. Most manual data registration is only available in the plant systems and not in the central portal.

For specification of the manual data registration available on each system, see the specific plant documentation.
