# Tracker State

The tracker state is normally calculated based on the operating mode of the tracker.

In addition, manual codes can be entered.

The calculation might vary from plant to plant, so look in page for specific equipment for rules.

General rule:

When it is detected externally that there is no irradiation to generate power on the Trackers (below 5 W/m2), code 7100 is set.

When it is detected grid is down, code 7105 is set.

Else, code from tracker is used.
