# Availability Calculations

The inverter state is used for plant availability calculations. An inverter state in the class Failure Time or Idle Time, reduces the availability and is defined as Non-Operational time. The percentage of state time for these state classes within a period defines the availability value. The availability is calculated as sum of all inverters.
